## General Issues

### I'm not sure if Ready-to-Review is working

**Diagnostic procedure**:

1. **Check the Dashboard**:
    - Navigate to `<your-org>.ready-to-review.dev`
    - Log in with GitHub
    - Do you see any PRs listed?

2. **Create a test PR**:
    - Make a small change in a monitored repository
    - Create a pull request
    - Wait 60 seconds

3. **Verify each component**:
    - **Dashboard**: Refresh and check if PR appears
    - **Slack**: Check configured channel for message
    - **Goose**: Check for desktop notification

If any component fails, proceed to that component's troubleshooting section below.

### Nothing works after installation

**Possible causes**:

1. **GitHub App not properly installed**
2. **Repository access not configured**
3. **Waiting for initial sync**

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify GitHub App installation**:
    - Go to [GitHub Settings → Installed GitHub Apps](https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/settings/installations)
    - Find "Ready-to-Review"
    - Verify it shows "Installed" status
    - Check "Repository access" includes your repositories

2. **Wait for initial sync**:
    - After installation, allow up to 60 seconds for data to sync
    - Refresh the Dashboard

3. **Check service status**:
    - Open an issue in the [support repository](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/support) to ask about service status

### PRs are not being tracked

**Symptoms**: Pull requests exist but don't appear in Ready-to-Review.

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify repository is monitored**:
    - Go to [GitHub Settings → Installed GitHub Apps](https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/settings/installations)
    - Click "Configure" on Ready-to-Review
    - Under "Repository access":
        - If "All repositories": All repos should be monitored
        - If "Only select repositories": Verify your repo is in the list

2. **Check repository visibility**:
    - Free plans (Grass Roots) only support public repositories
    - Verify your plan supports private repos: See [Plans & Features](plans.md)

3. **Verify PR is not a draft**:
    - Draft PRs are tracked but not assigned reviewers
    - Mark PR as ready for review

4. **Force a refresh**:
    - Close and reopen the PR
    - This triggers a full resync

## GitHub App Issues

### GitHub App installation failed

**Symptoms**: Error during GitHub App installation or configuration.

**Solutions**:

    - You need **Organization Owner** or **Admin** role
    - Go to [GitHub Organization Members](https://github.com/orgs/<your-org>/people)
    - Verify your role

2. **Check organization settings**:
    - Some organizations restrict GitHub App installations
    - Go to [Organization Settings → Third-party access](https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/settings/oauth_application_policy)
    - Verify third-party applications are allowed

3. **Try installation again**:
    - Go to [Ready-to-Review GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/ready-to-review-beta)
    - Click **Configure** (if previously installed) or **Install**
    - Follow installation steps

4. **Contact GitHub Support**:
    - If installation repeatedly fails, this may be a GitHub issue

## Notification Issues

### Not receiving any notifications

**Systematic check**:

1. **Dashboard**: Can you see PRs at `<org>.ready-to-review.dev`?
    - If no: [GitHub App Issues](#github-app-issues)
    - If yes: Continue to step 2

2. **Slack**: Did you install the Slack integration?
    - If no: Notifications will only appear in Dashboard and Goose
    - If yes: [Slack Integration Issues](#slack-integration-issues)

3. **Goose**: Did you install Goose?
    - If no: Notifications will only appear in Dashboard and Slack
    - If yes: [Goose Desktop App Issues](#goose-desktop-app-issues)

### Receiving duplicate notifications

**Symptoms**: Getting notified multiple times for the same PR event.

**Possible causes**:

1. **Multiple notification channels enabled**: Slack + Goose both notify (this is expected)
2. **Misconfigured Slack channels**: PR posted to multiple channels

**Solutions**:

1. **If Slack + Goose**:
    - This is normal behavior - you'll get both
    - Disable one if you prefer single-channel notifications

2. **If duplicate Slack messages**:
    - Check `.codeGROOVE/slack.yaml` for overlapping channel configurations
    - Look for wildcard `"*"` in multiple channels
    - See [Slack Integration - Wildcards and Precedence](slack.md#wildcards-and-precedence)

### Notifications are delayed

**Symptoms**: Notifications arrive minutes or hours late.

**Expected behavior**:

- **Dashboard**: Updates every 30-60 seconds
- **Slack**: 15-60 seconds from GitHub event
- **Goose**: 15-60 seconds from GitHub event
- **Slack DM delay**: 65 minutes if user is in channel (configurable)

**If notifications are delayed beyond this**:

1. **Check GitHub webhook delivery**:
    - Go to [Repository Settings → Webhooks](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/settings/hooks)
    - Find Ready-to-Review webhook
    - Check "Recent Deliveries" for failures

2. **Check service status**:
    - Rare outages may delay notifications
    - Open an issue in the [support repository](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/support)

3. **Slack workspace issues**:
    - Check [Slack Status](https://status.slack.com/)
    - Slack outages may delay DMs

## Configuration Issues

### YAML configuration not working

**Symptoms**: `.codeGROOVE/slack.yaml` changes don't take effect.

**Common mistakes**:

1. **File location**: Must be `.codeGROOVE/slack.yaml` in repository root (note the leading dot)

2. **YAML syntax errors**:
    ```yaml
    # ❌ Wrong - tabs used for indentation
    channels:
    	engineering:  # This is a tab
    		repos:
    			- myrepo

    # ✅ Correct - spaces used for indentation
    channels:
        engineering:  # This is 4 spaces
            repos:
                - myrepo
    ```

3. **Incorrect workspace URL**:
    ```yaml
    # ❌ Wrong - includes https://
    slack: https://myworkspace.slack.com

    # ✅ Correct
    slack: myworkspace.slack.com
    ```

4. **Typos in repository names**:
    ```yaml
    # Repository names are case-sensitive
    channels:
        engineering:
            repos:
                - api-sever  # ❌ Typo: should be "api-server"
    ```

**Debugging YAML**:

1. **Validate YAML syntax**:
    - Use [YAML Lint](https://www.yamllint.com/)
    - Paste your configuration and check for errors

2. **Test with minimal configuration**:
    ```yaml
    global:
        slack: myworkspace.slack.com

    channels:
        test-channel:
            repos:
                - "*"
    ```

3. **Verify file is committed**:
    ```bash
    git ls-files | grep .codeGROOVE
    ```
    Should output: `.codeGROOVE/slack.yaml`

4. **Check file permissions**:
    - File must be readable (not too restrictive permissions)

## Performance Issues

### High resource usage (Goose)

**Symptoms**: Goose uses excessive CPU or memory.

**Solutions**:

1. **Reduce polling frequency** (future feature - currently fixed at 5 minutes)

2. **Filter organizations**:
    - Click Goose icon → Organization Filter
    - Disable organizations you don't need to monitor

3. **Check for memory leaks**:
    - Restart Goose daily (or use auto-start on login to restart on reboot)
    - Report persistent issues to [support](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/support)

### Dashboard slow with many PRs

**Symptoms**: Dashboard takes >5 seconds to load.

**Solutions**:

1. **Use repository filtering**:
    - Filter to specific repositories instead of viewing all at once

2. **Close stale PRs**:
    - Close or merge PRs that have been open for >90 days
    - Reduces dashboard load

3. **Upgrade plan**:
    - Main Stage and Funk Master plans have optimized infrastructure
    - See [Plans & Features](plans.md)
