# Personal Use Setup

This guide walks you through setting up reviewGOOSE for personal use. You'll install the GitHub App and desktop notifications to stay on top of PRs.

**Time required:** ~1 minute

!!! important "GitHub App Required"
    The reviewGOOSE:GitHub App is required for:

    - **Real-time notifications** (under 1 second)
    - **Slack integration** (server needs to know which repos to track)
    - **Private repository access** (Pro/Flock plans)

    Without it, the desktop app falls back to polling (slower, rate-limited).
