## Security & Privacy

OAuth scopes requested:

- `read:org` - Organization membership

Data cached up to 28 days. No code access. Details: [Security](security.md)

## Interface

**Incoming**: PRs where you're assigned reviewer

**Outgoing**: PRs you created waiting for review or changes

**Drafts**: Your draft PRs not ready for review

### Status Tags

Each PR shows tags indicating what's blocking it:

- **Needs changes**: Fix CI failures, address review feedback, or resolve merge conflicts
- **Awaiting review**: Waiting for reviewers to approve
- **Ready to merge**: All approvals received, ready to ship
- **Draft**: Not ready for review yet
- **CI running**: Automated checks in progress

**Priority**: Focus on PRs where you're blocking progress (incoming PRs needing your review, or outgoing PRs needing your fixes).

### Search & Filter

Search box: Filter by PR title, repo name, author, or reviewer

Repository dropdown: Show PRs from specific repos only

Sort by: Updated, Created, Title, Repository

## Troubleshooting

**Can't log in**: Clear cookies for `*.reviewgoose.dev`, try incognito mode. Check GitHub Settings → Applications → Authorized OAuth Apps.

**No PRs shown**: Verify GitHub App installed on repos. Check [GitHub Settings → Installed GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/installations). Free plans don't include private repos.

**Wrong status**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R). Status cached up to 5 minutes.

**Slow**: Use repository filtering. Clear browser cache.
