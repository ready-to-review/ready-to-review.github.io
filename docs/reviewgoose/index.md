# reviewGOOSE

**PRs that merge in minutes, not days.**

---

## The Problem

Industry average PR merge time is **4.5 days**. Most of that is waiting—unclear whose turn it is, missed notifications, context switching.

## The Solution

reviewGOOSE tracks whose turn it is and notifies the right person at the right time.

## How It Works

1. **GitHub App** monitors your PRs
2. **Turn detection** determines who needs to act: fix tests, review, address feedback, merge
3. **Smart notifications** via Slack DM, channel post, or desktop app
4. **Dashboard** shows PRs organized by "waiting on you" vs "waiting on others"
