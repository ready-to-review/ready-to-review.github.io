# Getting Started

Set up reviewGOOSE for your team or personal use.

## Personal Use (~1 min)

For solo developers and open source contributors.

1. [Install the GitHub App](github-bot.md)
2. Choose your notification style:
    - [Desktop app](goose.md) - Menu bar with sounds and click-to-open
    - [CLI](cli.md) - Terminal view for shell-first workflows

You'll get notifications when PRs need your attention, wherever you work.

## Team Use (~15 min)

For teams deploying reviewGOOSE across an organization.

1. [Install the GitHub App](github-bot.md)
2. [View the Dashboard](dashboard.md)

4. Optionally install [Desktop](goose.md) or [CLI](cli.md) for individual notifications

You can use any combination of Desktop, CLI, Slack, and Discord for complete coverage.

## Evaluation Tips

- Start with 1-2 public repositories
- Public repos are free, no payment required
- Expand to private repos after validating the workflow
