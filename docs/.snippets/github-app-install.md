!!! tip "Free for Public Repositories"
    Access to public repositories is **completely free**. Start with 1-2 public repos to evaluate, then expand later if needed.

1. Visit: [reviewGOOSE:GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/reviewgoose)

2. Click **Install**

3. Choose your installation scope:

    === "Evaluating"

        - Select **Only select repositories**
        - Pick 1-2 public repositories for testing
        - Click **Install**

        **Why public repos?** They're lower risk for evaluation and let you verify the functionality before expanding to private repositories.
