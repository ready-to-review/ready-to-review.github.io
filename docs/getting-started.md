## Security & Privacy

Both setups are designed with security in mind:

- **GitHub App:** Only accesses repositories you explicitly grant it access to
- **Slack App:** Only sees channels you explicitly invite it to
- **Desktop App:** Runs entirely on your machine using your credentials

Start with 1-2 public repositories to evaluate risk-free before expanding to your full organization.
